# Input format
- First line contains two integers n and m representing the number of vertices and edges
- The next line contains two number start, talpha, tomega.
- The next m lines, the i-th line contains 4 number ui, vi, ti, di

# Output format
- One line contains n integers, the i-th integers representing the answer for the i-th vertex.

# Index
- Assume that index start from 1.

# Constraint
- n, m < 10^6
- di > 0
- talpha, tomega, ti < INT_MAX
